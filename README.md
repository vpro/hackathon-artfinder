## Todo

### Basic, find a museum

1.  App that allows you to create a profile (picture, buddy gender preference, basic info)
2.  App shows you pictures of art and you can swipe positive or negative. The museum to which the art belongs gets a plus or minus point, as well as the art piece.
3.  You can always check your current preferred museum based on the plus and minuses

### Extended version, find a buddy

App should let you find a buddy who has a minimum threshold of the same pluses/minuses for specific pieces of art.
